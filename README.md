# proton-mail-export-cli-tidy

A wrapper over proton-mail-export-cli to categorise the EML files into their original folders.

This helps with importing emails in a third party provider that does not have specific support for Proton's emails exports.

This script was generated by Claude Sonnet 4, with some prompted guidance to define the technical specification of Proton's mail export and requirements for this script.

## Requirements

- Copy the eml files into a directory on the file system which name corresponds to the Proton folder / tag the email is labelled with.

- An email can be in multiple folders and have multiple tags. However, in the output, the email will be filed in a single directory.

- Order of precedence for determining the label that will act as the destination directory:
* prefer a user created folder, if present
* failing that, use the system folder (Inbox, Trash, Sent, etc)
* and finally, use the tag, if nothing else applies

This guarantees that no matter how many labels an email is tagged on, only a single copy will be present in the `organized_emails` directory.

## Usage

First run Proton's CLI tool:
`/Applications/proton-mail-export-cli.app/Contents/MacOS/proton-mail-export-cli.sh`

Once the export has been produced, run the script:
`python3 proton_eml_organizer.py /full/path/to/proton/export/folder`

Example output (fictitious, counts don't add up):

```
Completed! Processed 1075 emails with 0 errors
Organized emails are in: /full/path/to/proton/export/folder/some_email@proton.me/mail_20250620_123456/organized_emails

## Tech notes

Each label has a type:
- `1`: Tag
- `3`: Folder

Labels with a numerical id are "system" folders / tags (supplied by Proton) whereas labels with a "complex" ID (a string that bears resemblance with a base64 coded string) are user-defined.
